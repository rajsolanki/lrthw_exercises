There are actually 5 strings with strings inside them. He didn't
need to write #{10} as a sting, he could have written it as an
integer, but he wrote it as a string so, yes I think he is lying
and there are 5 strings within a string, not 4.

Adding w + e creates a longer string because w and e are variables
that stand for two different shorter strings, so when you add the
variables, it prints the strings they are associated with together
as one string.

I prefer string interpolation of format strings because it seems
a bit less clunky and confusing to me.
