It was interesting to see that the print command
printed the words one right after the other, whereas
the puts command put Cheese on one line and Burger on 
the other. Puts adds a new line to the end of the output, print does not.

When I removed the last line of the program, it removed a blank line.
Therefore, I assume a puts with nothing after it prints a blank line.

Rubocop did not like the format string s% for 'snow' but I left it like that.
