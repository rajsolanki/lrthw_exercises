To remove the my_ from the code, I simply
used the replace function and entered "my_"
and left the what to replace part empty and
clicked "Replace All", and all the "my_" were
removed.

I played around with some other format sequences
after it took me way too long to realize what they are!
At least I finally understood.

So Rubocop does not like the formatting used for this chapter,
but researching it, it seems like I would need to completely
change the format to a "sprintf" format that is totally different, 
so I'm letting the offenses stand.

For the format sequences, I used <http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/Kernel.html>
as a reference.
