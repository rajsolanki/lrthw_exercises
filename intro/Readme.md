Intro to "Learning Ruby the Hard Way"

Q1: What are the three most essential skills that a beginner programmer needs to know?

  1) Reading and Writing Code

  2) Attention to Detail

  3) Spotting Differences

Q2: Please explain these three skills in your own words.

  Reading and Writing Code:
  Coding uses symbols and letters in a way that is a bit unique and different from standard English, so a coder must learn to read and write this new language.

  Attention to Detail:
  Coding requires exactness. If one thing is spelled incorrectly or formatted wrong, the code won't work. So, a coder needs to develop the skill of paying attention to the details to make his code successful.

  Spotting Differences:
  This is connected, I think, to paying attention to detail. It is important to be able to spot when seemingly similar code has subtle differences in order to catch mistakes and understand code more completely.

Q3: Why do you need to not copy and paste?

  The point of the exercises in this book is to help develop the ability to read and write code as well as to develop an attention to detail and an ability to spot differences in code, so copying and pasting will not allow one to develop these skills.
